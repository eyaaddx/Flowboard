# 🕹️ Dashboard of Chaos

Welcome to the **most unnecessary but beautifully crafted dashboard** on the internet.

Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Pure imagination (and possibly rage during layout debugging)

## 🧠 What is this?

A front-end playground disguised as a dashboard.  
Includes:
- Panels you don’t need.
- Data that isn’t real.
- A “course” section with deep links into unhinged content.
- And yes, Valorant made it in... somewhere. *You'll know when you see it.*

## 🥚 Easter Eggs?

This site is a landmine of hidden fun:
- 🔍 Try to find all **Spot Hiddens**
- 🥚 Several *Eggsters* are lurking
- 🔒 Secret mode? Maybe.

## 📦 Features (if we can call them that)
- Custom-styled file panels
- Context menu for right-click chaos (i tried to but rage quit won)
- Scroll-to-top with animation (you’re welcome)
- Micro animations just because I could
- Ultra-minimal sad Valorant-coded bear (he works here too)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This dashboard is **for fun and personal experimentation**. If it breaks, it’s probably your fault (just kidding… or am I?)
